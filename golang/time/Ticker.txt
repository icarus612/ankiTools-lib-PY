<i>Ticker</i>.Reset(<i>d</i>) | <b>Time function</b> that stops a ticker and resets its period to the specified duration. The next tick will arrive after the new period elapses. The duration d must be greater than zero; if not, Reset will panic.  |  | func (t *Ticker) Reset(d Duration) 
<i>Ticker</i>.Stop(<i></i>) | <b>Time function</b> that turns off a ticker. After Stop, no more ticks will be sent. Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a concurrent goroutine reading from the channel from seeing an erroneous "tick".  |  | func (t *Ticker) Stop()
