Vanishing Gradient Problem | The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, leading to slow or stalled learning in deep neural networks.
Weight Decay | Weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large parameter values. It helps prevent overfitting.
Xavier Initialization | Xavier initialization, also known as Glorot initialization, is a technique for initializing the weights of neural network layers to facilitate better convergence during training.
YOLO (You Only Look Once) | YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm that divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in each grid cell.
